What is it?
-----------

It is a chess game written in Python.  It follows all the standard
rules of chess.  However, I haven't finished it yet (see
Instructions).

Latest Version
--------------

The latest version of Python Chess can be found in my Github
repository at: https://github.com/nmathew33/Python-Chess.

Instructions
------------

Just run the chess.py file to start the game.  As of now, you can
click a piece and it will highlight the areas to which it can move.
However, there are no set moves and you can repeatedly move the same
piece or a piece of the same color.  The game also doesn't recognize
when you win or lose.
